# API Testing and Validation

This is the sample code for the LinkedIn Learning course "API Testing and Validation" from Keith Casey / @CaseySoftware.

## LinkedIn Course Instructions

_The course was built using PHP 8.2 and Behat 3.12 and these instructions are designed for that combination._

1. Ensure you have PHP installed. This course was built on PHP 8.2.x installed via Homebrew on a Mac.
2. Ensure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. 
3. Download or clone this repository.
4. On your command line, move to the `api-testing-workspace` directory.
6. Install your environment via `./composer.phar --install` or equivalent depending on your Composer configuration. This will load Behat 3.12 and the Github SDK for you.
8. Run `vendor/bin/behat --init` to create the framework for your tests.
9. All of your code, feature specifications, etc will be in `api-testing-workspace`. If you ever get stuck, check out the `api-testing-course` directory for the completed solutions.

Note: Do not rename `behat.dist.yml` to `behat.yml` at this time. Once you do, Behat will look for additional information. You'll rename and configure that information during the course.

## PHP Instructions

The PHP instructions are identical to the LinkedIn Learning instructions above.
